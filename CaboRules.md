## Cabo Card Game Rules

### Objective
The objective of Cabo is for each player to minimize the sum of their own cards. Players start with four face-down cards and can use card effects to reveal, manipulate, and swap cards throughout the game. The player with the lowest total score at the end of a round wins.

### Setup
1. **Players**: Cabo can be played with 2 or more players.
2. **Deck**: The game is played with a standard deck of cards (with optional jokers).
3. **Initial Deal**:
   - Each player is dealt **four cards face down**.
   - Players may **look at any two** of their own cards before the game begins, but should keep them face down afterward.
4. **Objective**: Minimize the sum of your four cards by swapping or discarding cards based on the gameâ€™s mechanics.

### Gameplay

#### Turn Structure
Players take turns in **clockwise order**, and on each turn, they may perform one of the following actions:

1. **Draw a Card from the Draw Pile**:
   - Players may pick a card from the **draw pile**.
   - After drawing, the player can either:
     - **Keep the card** by swapping it with one of their own face-down cards (placing the swapped card on the discard pile).
     - **Discard the card** (if the discarded card is a special "choice" card, the player may choose to activate its ability).

2. **Pick a Card from the Discard Pile**:
   - Players may choose to take the **top card** from the discard pile instead of drawing from the deck.
   - After picking from the discard pile, the player must discard one of their own face-down cards.

3. **Call "Cabo"**:
   - A player may call "Cabo" when they believe they have the lowest score among all players.
   - This triggers the **endgame phase** where all players must reveal their cards.

#### Special Card Abilities ("Choice" Cards)
If a player draws or discards certain cards, they may choose to activate their special abilities:

- **7 or 8**: Look at one of your own face-down cards.
- **9 or 10**: Look at one of another player's face-down cards.
- **Jack or Queen**: Swap any two cards on the table, from any player.
- **Black King**: Look at any two cards on the table and choose to swap them.

#### Stacking (Concurrent Play)
On any player's turn, if a card is placed on the discard pile, **other players can race to discard their own card of the same rank** by placing it on the discard pile.

- Only the **first player** to place their card of the same rank can discard it; no other players can stack once this card is placed.
- If a player mistakenly tries to stack an incorrect card, they must take a card from the deck **without looking at it** and add it to their hand face-down.

### Endgame

1. **Calling Cabo**:
   - When a player calls "Cabo", each other player gets **one more turn**.
   - After all players have taken their final turns, everyone reveals their face-down cards.

2. **Scoring**:
   - All players turn over their cards and total their values.
   - The player with the **lowest total score** wins the round.

### Scoring

- **Numbered Cards**: Worth their respective values (e.g., 2 is worth 2 points, 9 is worth 9 points).
- **Face Cards**: Worth **10 points** (Jacks, Queens).
- **Red Kings**: Worth **0 points**.
- **Jokers**: Worth **-1 point** (optional in some versions of the game).

### Additional Rules
- If a player manages to **discard all their cards**, then on their turn they must automatically call "cabo" and all players get one turn until it gets back to the person that discarded all their cards.
